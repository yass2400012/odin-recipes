<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Paila is a traditional Ecuadorian soup made with seafood, yuca, and a variety of other ingredients. The dish gets its name from the clay pot, or "paila," 
    in which it is typically prepared. To make paila, first saut√© onions, garlic, and tomatoes in oil, then add fish or seafood broth and bring to a simmer. 
    Add yuca, green plantains, and other vegetables such as carrots and peas, and continue cooking until the vegetables are tender. 
    Finally, add shrimp, clams, or other seafood, along with cilantro, cumin, and other seasonings to taste. 
    Serve hot with a side of rice or toasted corn kernels. Paila is a hearty and flavorful dish that is perfect for a chilly evening or as a main course 
    for a special occasion.
